# This script installs Rubberduck for the VBE and runs all tests in the active VBA project.
# It uses the Inno Setup installer for Rubberduck, which is a popular open-source VBA add-in for unit testing and code inspection.
# The script is designed to be run in a PowerShell environment and requires administrative privileges to install the add-in.

# The script performs the following steps:
# 1. Downloads the latest version of Rubberduck from GitHub.
# 2. Installs Rubberduck using the Inno Setup installer with specified command line options to suppress prompts and run silently.
# ======

# Step 1:

# Download the latest version of Rubberduck from GitHub
# The URL is constructed using the latest release version from the Rubberduck GitHub repository.
# The script uses the Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet to download the installer to a temporary location.
$rubberduckUrl = "https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/releases/download/v2.5.91/Rubberduck.Setup.2.5.9.6316.exe"


$tempInstallerPath = "$env:TEMP\Rubberduck.Setup.exe"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $rubberduckUrl -OutFile $tempInstallerPath

# Step 2:
# Install Rubberduck using the Inno Setup installer with specified command line options
# The script uses the Start-Process cmdlet to run the installer with the /SILENT and /NORESTART options to suppress prompts and prevent automatic restarts.
$installerArgs = "/SILENT /NORESTART /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /LOG=$env:TEMP\RubberduckInstall.log"
Start-Process -FilePath $tempInstallerPath -ArgumentList $installerArgs -Wait
# The -Wait parameter ensures that the script waits for the installation to complete before proceeding.

# Output logs to the console
# The script uses the Get-Content cmdlet to read the installation log file and display its contents in the console.
# This can help troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the installation process.
# Note: Use -Tail 500 to limit the output to the last 500 lines of the log file.
