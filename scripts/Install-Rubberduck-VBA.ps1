# This script installs Rubberduck for the VBE and runs all tests in the active VBA project.
# It uses the Inno Setup installer for Rubberduck, which is a popular open-source VBA add-in for unit testing and code inspection.
# The script is designed to be run in a PowerShell environment and requires administrative privileges to install the add-in.

# The script performs the following steps:
# 1. Downloads the latest version of Rubberduck from GitHub.
# 2. Installs Rubberduck using the Inno Setup installer with specified command line options to suppress prompts and run silently.
# ======

# Step 1:

# Download the latest version of Rubberduck from GitHub
# The URL is constructed using the latest release version from the Rubberduck GitHub repository.
# The script uses the Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet to download the installer to a temporary location.

# Step 2:
# Install Rubberduck using the Inno Setup installer with specified command line options
# The script uses the Start-Process cmdlet to run the installer with the /SILENT and /NORESTART options to suppress prompts and prevent automatic restarts.
